* **Be Curious, Value Learning and Uniquely combine your Skills**
* Learning as a **Choice and not a Chore**

### Pillars

* Everything is a Game
  * Growth mindset that everything is trainable
  * I'm not smart enough to do this yet
* **Feynman Technique**
  * Explain it in such a basic level that even a Child can understand(This helps in Recalling)
* **Trunk Based Knowledge**
  * First Principles: https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/
    * Break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up
    * Ask Questions like Why, When, How to multiple levels
* Efficiency Trumps Grit
  * Manage your time and energy, be efficient, instead of hustling all the time.
  * Use the right strategies to get ahead

### Science

* Focus vs Diffuse Mode
  * Focus: All our concentration on one Task(Studying for Exam)
  * Diffused: Relaxed mode where our mind wanders(Taking a walk, Sleep)
  * Strategy is to switch between the two
  * Multi-tasking can make you less efficient
* The Science of Sleep
  * Pulling all nighters is the worst thing to do
  * Sleep flushes out all the toxin accumulated throughout the Day
* Brain Training
  * Keep learning new things to make new connections(Synapses joining and forming a connection)
  * Practise things so that the connections don't disappear and makes it stronger
  * Physical Exercise and Day Dreaming is also Good
* Feedback
  * Embrace negative feedback and improve on those things
    * From this, you'll get to know where you need to improve
  * Initial positive feedback encourages you to do things better
* Procrastination
  * Start doing it even when you feel you don't have the mood
    * Screw it, let's do it
    * Sloppy start
    * Small steps
  * Later on, that negative feeling would go away
* Long and Short term Memory
  * Long Term: Practise and Recall, Repeat(Spaced Repetition)
  * Short Term
    * Make connections with existing concepts(Relations)
    * Make weird connections with existing things like Hot Ramen for Ra(God of Sun-Egypt)
* Active vs Passive Learning
  * Passive: Just watching or listening
  * Active: Engage like ask questions and put it to practice
  * Recalling is better than Rereading or Repeating
* Motivation
  * Intrinsic: To have Control, Mastery and Purpose
  * External: Money and Prize
* Goals
  * Take small steps to achieve the Goal
  * https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf
  * SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound
  * My Goals:
    * Projects using React, Node and other Tech
    * Getting better at Coding
    * Doing well in Interviews
  * https://nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/not-all-practice-makes-perfect
  * **Deliberate Practice or Purposeful practice**
    * I just played it(Usual Practice) vs
    * Play the piece all the way through at the proper speed without a mistake three times in a row(Purposeful Practice)
    * Needs *feedback* (Success or Failure, Wrong or Correct, Right way or Wrong way)
    * Push yourself *beyond your comfort zone*
      * come at it from a different direction
    * Set SMART goals
* Don't be busy all the time
  * Take time to relax, as this is better for the Brain
* Learning in Chunks
  * Top Down and Bottom Up approach: Connect between them(Relation between Keywords or most basic thing)
* Problem Solving
  * Some in Focussed and some in Diffused mode of thinking
* Spaced Repetition
  * Spread out practice
* Habits are Energy Savers
  * Form habits that will help you
    * Waking early
    * Plan for the next day in the previous night
